# Welcome to Eli's coding bootcamp!
This bootcamp is an introduction for those who are afraid of, overwhelmed 
by or just curious about programming. Our objective will be to have a basic understanding of 
programming syntax so you can start working on your own project after just 2 or 3 sessions. 

# So, what's the plan?
## We will
- Briefly talk about what code exactly is and does
- Learn code rudiments and practice in **Javascript**
- Work on a real project and develop a basic web app in **React**
- Answer your questions and doubts about specific topics (ie: WordPress)

# How to open a terminal
We will have to use the terminal for a few things in the bootcamp. Here's how to open one
- On Windows, press CTRL + R, then type `cmd`, then OK
- On macOS, press command + space, then type `terminal`, then select the terminal

Some basic commands that are useful:
1. `cd` brings you back to your root directory
2. `cd /path/to/my/super/cool/directory` brings you to a directory
3. `ls` shows you the files and directories located in the directory you are in
4. Up and down arrows in the terminal will allow you to navigate the previously executed commands
5. CTRL / command + C cancels the ongoing command

# How to setup the project 
1. Install **node-js**: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install an **IDE** (this is what we will use to write the code). You have a few choices here:
   1. Webstorm by JetBrains (costs money but you can use the free trial) - 
   https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/
   2. Visual Studio by Microsoft (free) - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
3. Create a **github** account: https://github.com/join
   1. Follow this tutorial to link your account to **git**: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git
4. Finally, clone this repository to get access to the code. The steps to follow are:
   1. Open a terminal 
   2. Navigate to the directory you want to use to host the project
   3. Clone this repository by typing this command `git clone git@github.com:Elidoudly/eli-coding-bootcamp.git` and pressing enter
